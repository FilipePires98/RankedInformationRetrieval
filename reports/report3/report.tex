\section{Introduction}

This report was written for the discipline of 'Information Retrieval' and 
describes the implementation and evaluation of a ranked retrieval method that 
uses the indexes created with the solutions developed for the previous assignments.

We include the correction of design flaws of the delivery done prior to this one
and the updates applied both to the text corpus indexation and to our class diagram.
We also provide the instructions on how to run our code.

Along with the description of the solution, we also present the results of our
calculations to evaluate the solution and determine its efficiency according to 
the metrics proposed for this last assignment \cite{assign3}.
All code and documentation is present in our public GitHub project at 
\url{https://github.com/joao-alegria/RI}.

\section{Re-Indexing the Corpus}

In order to make query searches flexible, it was proposed to us the reindexation
of the text corpus considering not only the document titles but also their abstracts.
This turned out to be quite challenging due to its computational weight, as 
the abstracts were considerably larger than the titles.
The initial index occupied about 500Mb in disk, whereas the reindexation turned
out to be over 3Gb large.

There were 2 approaches when adding the abstract processing to our indexing process. 
The first one would consist in dealing with titles and abstracts separately,
creating independent index entries for both. 
This approach has the advantage of simplifying the process of verification of 
appearance of a given term in titles, abstracts or both, since they would be 
stored in different structures.
It has however the clear disadvantage of requiring far more disk space to store
all the information and introducing redundancy and unnecessary repetitions.

With this in mind, we went for another strategy, consisting of concatenating 
both fields and processing the resulting text as a whole.
This approach's advantage and disadvantage are inverted when compared to the 
previous, since the redundancy no longer exists but it becomes impossible to
distinguish the field a term appears at.
Our choice was based on the analysis of the requirements for the ranked retriever
we wanted to implement, as there seemed to be no need to keep the notion of where
each term appeared at in each document.
This also made the code adaptations to the indexing pipeline more straightforward 
and, as we previously mentioned, the final size in disk of the index smaller.
The execution time of this pipeline thankfully did not evolve as fast as the
disk space, passing from 20 minutes without the abstract to approximately 1 hour
and 20 minutes with it.

\section{Ranked Retrieval of Relevant Documents}

With an entirely functional index creator and a folder of generated indexes from
the corpus of text documents, it was now time to develop a program capable of
interpreting queries and returning the index entries most relevant to them.
In this chapter we describe our implementation of a query results ranked retriever
- that we called \texttt{Searcher}.
We also explain how we prepared it for memory limitations and present the 
updates done to our class diagram.

\subsection{Document Ranked Scores}

The file \texttt{Searcher.py} contains an abstract class called \texttt{Searcher}
that serves as a template for the implementations of results retriever classes.
For our purposes, we developed \texttt{IndexSearcher}, a class that extends from
the abstract template and is capable of selecting which index files will be 
required to answer a given query, assigning scores to documents from the index
and returning the documents considered most relevant to the query according to 
these scores.

The step of determining which index files will be needed to answer the query
is done through the function \textit{retrieveRequiredFiles()} and is basically
a comparison of each query term with the name of each index file.
As each index file is named after the first and last terms it contains (separated
by an underscore) and as the entire index is alphabetically ordered, the function
simply determines where each term will be present and returns those index files.

Calculating the score of each document regarding a query is not as easy to explain.

Once the scores are found, \textit{sortAndWriteResults()} does what its name 
suggests: sorts the documents by score and writes to a results file the first K
documents, where K is passed as argument by the user.

\subsection{Relevance Feedback}

We knew \texttt{IndexSearcher} was a very limited solution, as it considers 
documents as relevant only for the presence of query terms in their titles 
and / or abstracts.
So the idea of attempting to expand queries was introduced through feeding back
to the Searcher information that would help it fine tune its results.

The aim of relevance feedback is to transform query vectors (consisting in the
weights of each query term in the query) into new vectors closer to the actually
relevant documents and further away from the remainder.
The way we implemented this form of attempting to improve results was through 
a well known algorithm named Rocchio algorithm.

\section{Evaluation and Results Discussion}

In order to evaluate the quality of our solutions, with and without relevance 
feedback, we calculate an assortment of performance metrics.
The chosen metrics were: Precision, Recall, F-Measure, Mean Precision at rank 10, 
Mean Precision, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain, and all the averages in 
between the queries performed for all the previous metrics.
The implementation of the calculations was done in \texttt{QueryAnalyzer.py}.
Time related metrics were also considered, such as: Query Throughput and Median 
Query Latency, but for these we chose to use an auxiliary linux command line 
program called \texttt{time} which is able to summarize the system resources 
used in a program's execution.

In this chapter we explain the metrics used to evaluate the implemented ranked
retrieval, present the results of our evaluation and our discussion regarding 
them and attempt to understand what exactly are the solutions limitations.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

Precision and recall are one of the most used metrics in information retrieval.
The first is characterized by dividing the correct retrieved documents by the 
totality of retrieved documents. 
This metric provides the percentage of the retrieved documents that are really 
relevant for the user.
The second consists of dividing the correct retrieved documents by the totality 
of ideal correct documents. 
The result is the percentage of correct documents the system can present.

F-Measure (or F-Score) is a metric many times used to represent the system 
performance with only one value. 
This is accomplish by the combination of the two previous metrics, performing 
the harmonic mean between the two metrics through the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  Fs = \frac{2 \times P \times R}{P + R}
\end{equation}

Mean Precision is a variation of the Precision metric. 
Its formula is similar, the difference is that in this case the precision 
is calculated in the various ranks, i.e. it is calculated for every newly 
retrieved document and then the average of all the intermediate precisions 
is achieved, resulting in the mean of the precisions of the query result
(hence the name).
Mean Precision at rank 10 is described as the Mean Precision calculated just 
until rank 10 (unitl the $10^{th}$ value).

Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain is a more complex metric that uses a graded 
relevance scale of documents to evaluate usefulness/gain of the returned results. 
The core idea with this metric is that relevant documents that are lower in the 
list should be penalized, since the important documents should be the first 
results provided. 
This is accomplished by the formula:

\begin{equation}
  DCG = \sum_{i=1}^{p} \frac{rel_{i}}{\log_{2}(i+1)}
\end{equation}

The normalization is then achieved by dividing this value by the ideal one, i.e.
having the relevances in order, the first documents considered the most relevant 
and so on.

Query Throughput is a time related metric that indicates how many queries can be 
processed in one second. 
It's obvious that it's ideal that the information gathering and ordering should 
take the least amount of time possible, so the higher the query throughput the better.

Finally, the Median Query Latency, as the name suggests, is the average time it
takes to process a query. 
Following the same logical line of thought of the previous metric, the lower 
this number is the better, since it means that more queries can be processed in 
less time.
