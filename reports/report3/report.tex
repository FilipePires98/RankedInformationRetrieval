\section*{Introduction}

This report was written for the discipline of 'Information Retrieval' and 
describes the implementation and evaluation of a ranked retrieval method that 
uses the indexes created with the solutions developed for the previous assignments.

We include the correction of design flaws of the delivery done prior to this one
and the updates applied both to the text corpus indexation and to our class diagram.
We also provide the instructions on how to run our code.

Along with the description of the solution, we also present the results of our
calculations to evaluate the solution and determine its efficiency according to 
the metrics proposed for this last assignment \cite{assign3}.
All code and documentation is present in our public GitHub project at 
\url{https://github.com/joao-alegria/RI}.

\section*{1. Re-Indexing the Corpus}

The first step to index the document corpus with the format intented was to 
consider not only the title of each document but now also
